        <h2 id="why-girocode-invoices">Why Use GiroCode on Invoices?</h2>
        <p>
          Every invoice you send without a GiroCode forces your client to manually type
          your IBAN, the exact amount and the payment reference – each of those characters
          is an opportunity for a typo. According to studies by European banking associations,
          around <strong>1 in 20 manual IBAN entries contains at least one error</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>Statistics: How long does an average bank transfer take?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Invoices without a payment QR code are paid on average <strong>3–5 days later</strong> than invoices with a QR code</li>
          <li>The average invoice-to-payment cycle in Germany is <strong>14–21 days</strong> for invoices without scan-to-pay</li>
          <li>With GiroCode, clients who scan immediately pay within <strong>1–3 days</strong> of receiving the invoice</li>
          <li>Late payment rates drop by up to <strong>30%</strong> when invoices include a GiroCode</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Benefits for invoice senders</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Faster cash flow:</strong> Earlier payments improve liquidity</li>
          <li><strong>Fewer errors:</strong> No mistyped IBANs or wrong amounts</li>
          <li><strong>Less chasing:</strong> Fewer follow-up calls and emails about payment status</li>
          <li><strong>Automatic reconciliation:</strong> Pre-filled payment reference enables automatic invoice matching</li>
          <li><strong>Professional image:</strong> Positions you as a modern, tech-forward business</li>
          <li><strong>No additional cost:</strong> Unlike payment processors, GiroCode incurs no per-transaction fees</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Benefits for payers (customers)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fast and convenient:</strong> Scan, verify, confirm – done in under 30 seconds</li>
          <li><strong>Error-free:</strong> No manual data entry, no risk of typos</li>
          <li><strong>Works with any bank:</strong> All major German banking apps support GiroCode scanning</li>
          <li><strong>No third-party account needed:</strong> Unlike PayPal, no additional registration required</li>
        </ul>

      <section aria-labelledby="legal-requirements" className="mt-10">
        <h2 id="legal-requirements">Legal Requirements for Invoices (EU/Germany)</h2>
        <p>
          A GiroCode is a payment convenience feature – it does not change or replace the
          legal requirements for invoices. German VAT law and the EU VAT Directive specify
          which information must appear on every invoice:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Full name and address</strong> of both the supplier and the customer</li>
          <li><strong>VAT identification number (USt-IdNr.)</strong> of the supplier</li>
          <li><strong>Invoice date</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Consecutive invoice number</strong> – must be unique and sequential</li>
          <li><strong>Quantity and description</strong> of the goods or services provided</li>
          <li><strong>Date of supply or service</strong> (if different from invoice date)</li>
          <li><strong>Net amount</strong> per line item and total</li>
          <li><strong>Applicable VAT rate(s)</strong> and <strong>VAT amount</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Gross amount</strong> (total including VAT)</li>
          <li><strong>Bank details</strong> (IBAN, optionally BIC) for payment</li>
          <li><strong>Payment terms</strong> (payment deadline)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The GiroCode encodes the bank details in machine-readable form as a convenience.
          The same information should also appear in human-readable form on the invoice.
        </p>

        <h3>Small business exemption (Kleinunternehmerregelung)</h3>
        <p>
          In Germany, businesses whose annual turnover is below EUR 22,000 can apply for the
          small business exemption under § 19 UStG. Under this scheme, you do not charge VAT,
          and your invoices must include the following disclaimer:
        </p>
        <p className="rounded-md border border-slate-700 bg-slate-900/40 p-3 text-sm italic text-slate-300">
          &ldquo;Pursuant to § 19 UStG (small business regulation), this invoice does not
          include VAT.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          GiroCodes work identically for small business invoices.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="placement" className="mt-10">
        <h2 id="placement">Where to Place the GiroCode on an Invoice</h2>

        <h3>Bottom right (recommended)</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>bottom-right corner</strong> of the invoice is the most universally
          recognised and expected location for a GiroCode. This placement mirrors the
          position of traditional payment slips in Germany and Austria.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GiroCode should be placed <strong>near the bank details section</strong> of the
          invoice, typically below or beside the IBAN, BIC and account holder name.
        </p>

        <h3>Minimum size (2×2 cm recommended)</h3>
        <p>
          For <strong>printed invoices</strong>, the GiroCode should have a minimum size of{' '}
          <strong>2 × 2 cm</strong>. A size of <strong>3 × 3 cm</strong> is recommended for
          better scan reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
          For <strong>digital invoices (PDF)</strong>, the QR code should be at least
          200 × 200 pixels. A size of 300–400 pixels is more comfortable for scanning from
          a screen.
        </p>

        <h3>Distance from edges and contrast</h3>
        <p>
          The QR code must have a <strong>quiet zone</strong> – a clear white border – of at
          least 4 QR code modules on all four sides. Print the QR code in{' '}
          <strong>black on white background</strong>.
